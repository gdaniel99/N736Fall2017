## Dates:			

* Classes begin August 23 – end December 5, 2017
* Exam Period December 6 - 16, 2017

## Course Objective:

To build and expand upon the statistical theory and methods learned in BIOS 500 and 501 and improve the student’s statistical software experience and programming skills with SAS, SPSS or R to improve research scholarship and dissemination.

## Course Description: 

This course builds on the required statistical sequence and focuses on practical application of statistics including understanding clinical research questions. Analyzing data is the major emphasis of the course including examining if assumptions of the statistical analysis are being met and interpreting the findings.  Course assignments focus on using statistical software and computing resources to analyze data sets from actual clinical research studies and interpretation of output and literature.

## General Outline:

1. Computing Environment (SAS, SPSS, R, Other Supporting Software)
2. Getting data into and out of statistical software (import, export features)
3. Reproducible Research Principles (documentation, reporting, version control)
4. Initial data assessments: univariate and bivariate methods, parametric and non-parametric
5. Regression methods: linear, logistic and introduction to “generalized”
6. Analysis of (co)Variance: univariate and multivariate, ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANOVA, MANCOVA 
7. Longitudinal analysis: repeated measures with introduction to multi-level models (MLM)
8. Assessment and testing of data & model assumptions (including missing data)
9. Introduction to Factor Analysis, Reliability and Discriminant Analysis, and SEM (structural equation modeling) as time allows

## Evaluations:

* 7 Homework assignments		70% (10% each)
* FINAL Project				30% (3 milestones: 5%, 5%, 20%)

## Homework:

Homework will be assigned every 1 to 2 weeks (total of 7 assignments). Detailed instructions will be provided with each homework. However, the goal of each assignment is two-fold: (1) to demonstrate that you know how to use your statistical software to execute the appropriate analyses requested in each assignment and (2) present your results in a professional manner equivalent to what is required for peer-reviewed research journal submissions.

## FINAL Data Analysis Project (more details to come later in semester) [100 points]:

1. Datasets will be provided to choose from or you can bring in an appropriate one of your choice, but the dataset must be approved by the instructor prior to executing your final analysis.
2. [10 points] Develop a short proposal including a description of the dataset, how it was acquired, sampling design, hypotheses, and analysis plan(s)
3. Analyze the data using your statistical software
4. Write up “journal-ready” (APA formatting guidelines) sections for each of the following:
    a. [5 points] (brief) Background of data and purpose of the planned analyses (i.e. your hypotheses)
    b. [20 points] Methods section
    c. [15 points] Results
    d. [15 points] Tables and Figures as needed
    e. [15 points] Discussion of results and conclusions drawn
5. [20 points] Provide a copy of your dataset (with appropriate details on your labels and “codebook/formats”) and complete analysis syntax/code used to complete your analyses

## Grading:

I will strive to post grades for each assignment within a week of turning in your homework and project milestones. You are welcome to inquire about your grades at any time during the semester. The instructor will strive to provide continuous feedback throughout the semester relative to your projected final grade for the course.

## Instructor provided help as needed/as requested: 

Additional help outside of class time will be provided as requested (please send email to [mailto:melinda.higgins@emory.edu](mailto:melinda.higgins@emory.edu).
